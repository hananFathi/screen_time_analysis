# screen_time_analysis
Overview
The Screen Time Analysis project aims to provide insights into user behavior by analyzing data related to application usage, notifications, and app openings. By examining the provided dataset, the project seeks to identify the most used applications and understand the factors influencing a user's screen time.

Dataset
The dataset includes the following key information:

Date
Usage of Applications (time spent on each app)
Number of Notifications from Applications
Number of times apps opened

Objectives
Identify Most Used Applications:

Determine which applications are used the most based on the total time spent on each.
Factors Influencing Screen Time:

Analyze correlations between screen time and other variables (e.g., number of notifications, frequency of app openings).
Explore patterns based on specific dates, days of the week, or times of the day.
User Behavior Insights:

Identify user preferences by analyzing the types of applications that contribute significantly to screen time.
Tools and Libraries Used
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebooks

Results
The project outcomes, including visualizations and key insights, are available in the Jupyter Notebook. Users interested in understanding their screen time patterns and application usage can benefit from the identified trends and factors influencing screen time.The factor depending on usage of applications is the notifications they receive.
